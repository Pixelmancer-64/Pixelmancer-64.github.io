My personal website hosted with gitub pages.

This website is solely static (no fancy React stuff here!). It has a lot of cool stuff but, for future features, it is best to move to a modern framework.

I am currently working on a new version for my website using Astro, React and MDX, so I can create and show you more cool programming stuff that I do.
